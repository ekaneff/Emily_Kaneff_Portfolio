# Emily_Kaneff_Portfolio
My goal is to be recognized, remembered, and noticed as a web designer and developer. I want to educate people on the significance of web designers in todayâ€™s industry, since they are often times overlooked. Through my education at Full Sail University, I hope to gather enough skill to be part of something huge to where if someone were to search "Big Names in the Web Design Industry", my name would appear in the top 20. I want to become masterful at user interface design with suffienct knowledge in development in order to successfully be a freelance designer.
