	I finished the career module in lab today. I also helped a fellow classmate with his CSS for his site, which helped me understand some problems with my code. I created my user story list and started on the interactive website course in code academy.

	I made more progress in the code academy course. I also helped a fellow classmate again with his design for his website. I looked at some examples of flat design since thatâ€™s what the trend is right now. I worked on the Captain America vector art project and realized how time consuming it is going to be.
