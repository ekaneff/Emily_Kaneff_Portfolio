	Today I made my list for this week. I also began working in the PHP code academy course since it is only about 3 hours long. I completed the first few assignments in the career module as well.

	I made more progress in the PHP course.
	I looked at my old work from my design class to refresh on wire framing skills.

	I made even more progress in the PHP course. I hope to be at least 80% done by the end of Thursday. 
	I began barnstorming and sketching what I want my mock up to look like.
	I watched parts of a Lynda video on basic Illustrator skills I couldnâ€™t remember. 

Thursday January 14, 2016
	I completed 60% in the PHP course. 
	I finished one art board of my website mock up for Healthy Shopper.
	I went through the links located in the Development section in FSO.
	I hope to have the PHP course finished by the end of the day tomorrow as well as another art board for my website. I also hope to go to the library to look for information on Java that I could use for my Fortune Teller. I plan to dedicate the last few days in the week strictly to that project. 
	I also turned in the Anchor Points for this week.
