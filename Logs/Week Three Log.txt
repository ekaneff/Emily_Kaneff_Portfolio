	Today during class, I created my user story list for this week. I realized that this week I want to work on a big project that I can potentially work on throughout my degree as I learn new skills. I also successfully added a fail safe to my Cootie Catcher program so now the user can only input data that is listed as an option. For the rest of the week, I need to focus on learning Javascript and building my website.

	I began the basic code for my “about me” website. I decided that I was going to leave out the Javascript element for this week, and focus more on learning the language. Then next week, I will improve on the side by adding the JavaScript element.

	After dealing with a lot of personal situations this week, I decided that I am going to focus more on JavaScript next week. I put my focus into relearning CSS and HTML and made headway on the website. I want to spend more time next week improving it all still. I also submitted the anchor points assignment after having done a stand up demo in class.

	I made progress in the career module course and checked out a few of the links under the development assignment on FSO.

	I finished what I wanted to get done of the website this week. I plan to add more content as well as more intense CSS and JavaScript elements. I also completed the first quiz for the career module.
