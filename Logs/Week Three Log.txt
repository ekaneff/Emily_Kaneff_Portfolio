	Today during class, I created my user story list for this week. I realized that this week I want to work on a big project that I can potentially work on throughout my degree as I learn new skills. I also successfully added a fail safe to my Cootie Catcher program so now the user can only input data that is listed as an option. For the rest of the week, I need to focus on learning Javascript and building my website.

	I began the basic code for my “about me” website. I decided that I was going to leave out the Javascript element for this week, and focus more on learning the language. Then next week, I will improve on the side by adding the JavaScript element.
