	I signed up for GitHub and created a repo. I am still trying to figure out how to add files into this repo, however. I watched part of a Lynda video on setting up GitHub as well as walked through some tutorials on the actual site itself.

	Today I did the call to action assignment. I looked online to find some big names in the web industry that I should be familiar with. Among the ones I found was Dan Cederholm, who is a co-founder of dribble.com, which is a website for designers to upload shots of their work as it progresses. I also completed the “Try Git” course on code school to familiarize myself with the workings of Git so that I can effectively utilize GitHub.

	Today was the day that I finally figured out how to use GitHub. I learned how to push files to GitHub from my local repo as well as create directories, which is what I was struggling with a lot. I also finished the Anchor Points assignment and submitted it to the discussion board. I wrote the README statement as well. I began watching the Lynda video on Photoshop for Web Designers so that by the end of the week I can hopefully make a basic mock up of a potential website. I also did more research on industry professionals, as well as looked at well designed websites so I can see the level on which I need to be coming out of school.

	Today I got further in the Lynda video on Photoshop and stopped at point where I felt confident enough to begin a project. I began working on a Halsey album cover.

	Today I finished my Halsey edit as well as wrote the end of the week summary that I will submit by the end of the day. I also watched more of the Lynda video to see if there was anything else I wanted to try to learn. I started thinking about what I want to do next week, as well.
