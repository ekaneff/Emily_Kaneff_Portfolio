	I signed up for GitHub and created a repo. I am still trying to figure out how to add files into this repo, however. 
	I watched part of a Lynda video on setting up GitHub as well as walked through some tutorials on the actual site itself.

	Today I did the call to action assignment. 
	I looked online to find some big names in the web industry that I should be familiar with. 
	Among the ones I found was Dan Cederholm, who is a co-founder of dribble.com, which is a website for designers to 
	upload shots of their work as it progresses.

	I also completed the “Try Git” course on code school to familiarize myself with the workings of Git so that I can 
	effectively utilize GitHub.

	Today was the day that I finally figured out how to use GitHub. I learned how to push files to GitHub from my local repo as well as create directories, which is what I was struggling with a lot. I also finished the Anchor Points assignment and submitted it to the discussion board. I wrote the README statement as well.
